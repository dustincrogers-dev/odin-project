<h1> Fried egg tortilla </h1>

<h3> Description </h3>
Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all in the same pan. Add your favorite toppings–like salsa, jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro, and green onions–and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if you have company.

<h4> Ingredients </h4>
<ul>
	<li>12  tsp	    butter</li>
	<li>1		    large egg</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon    taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
	<li>1 1/2 ounces    shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
	<li>1 (6 to 7-inch) flour tortilla</li>
	
</ul>

<h4> Steps </h4>
<ol>
	<li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>	
	<li>Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.</li>	
	<li>Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.</li>	
	<li>Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.</li>	
	<li>Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.</li>
</ol>
